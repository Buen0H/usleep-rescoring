''' U-Sleep Rescoring GUI.
This tool can allow an expert to rescore low confidence time periods from an
autonomous scoring neural network. In low condifdence time periods, this tool will 
display the 30 seconds of raw data for the experiment and allow the expert to input
the correct sleep stage.

TODO
- Validate analyze_uncertain_periods logic with Sarah.
- Reorder biosignal channels [EOG x2, front EEG, ... , back EEG, EMG x2]
- Mark rescoring periods on the scoring plot
- Add a stage 2 to find start of wake cycles.
- Autoscaling; change scale of individual channels +30, +50 uV +130, +
- Disable channels
- Score artifact
- Handle subject_id switching
- Handle disabling of forward button when out of bounds
QUESTIONS
- What exactly are we recoring? The uncertain periods or the 30 second epochs?
- Reminder on what the stage 2 of the rescoring of wake cycles will look like.
